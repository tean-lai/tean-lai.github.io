## **Short version**

Hello world! I'm Tean.

I am a computer science student, in my last year at <span class="red-text">Cornell</span>.

I am mainly interested in programming languages, systems, and algorithms.

My hobbies include calisthenics, bouldering, video games, martial arts, skill toys, and music.

This website is my space to share things.

## **Longer version**

I'm still Tean.

Current status on my hobbies:
- **Bouldering**: Working towards consistently climbing V2.
- **Video games**: Most recently completed Silksong.
- **Martial arts**: Currently learning some Taekwondo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu through school.
- **Programming languages**: My favorites so far are OCaml and Java. I dislike Python. I am looking to try Rust, Go, or some Lisp next.
- **Hardware**: Currently been spending some time on RTL for systolic array matrix multiplication.
