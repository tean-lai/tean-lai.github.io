Hi, I'm Tean. I am a computer scientist interested in compilers, programming languages, and hardware. I'm in my senior year of college at Cornell. Welcome to my website!

Most recently, I interned at Semgrep, a startup that focuses on scanning code really well (which could be used for cybersecurity, but I think the cooler part is its PL-heavy OCaml codebase). I've also been involved in PL/formal verification research. I'm also a part of the student-led project team C2S2's digital subteam, doing a lot of Verilog things.



## Hobbies
I tend to pick up new hobbies and switch around pretty quickly, so I'm kind of an amateur at everything.

Here are some hobbies I have been going on and off:
- (On)  Calisthenics, recently started bouldering too
- (On)  Video games! My favorite games include the Xenoblade series, Zelda, and the Nier series. Currently, I'm trying to play some more story-driven games.
  - I think League of Legends has made me a better student, [hear me out](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school).
  - My [thoughts on games](garden/my-thoughts-on-games.md) I've played.
- (Off) Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- (Off) Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most.
<!-- - (On)  Running -- I only recently realized that cardio is something important, so I've been trying to run more -->
