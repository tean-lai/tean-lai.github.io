Hello world! I'm Tean.

I am a computer science student, in my last year at <span class="red-text">Cornell</span>.

I use this site to share my knowledge and experiences, check out [notes](notes)! If you want to know more about me professionally, check out [professional](pro-tean).

Here's a little more about what I'm up to these days!
