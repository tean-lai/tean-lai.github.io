Hi, I'm Tean. I am a 3rd year CS major interested in programming languages and hardware. Welcome to my website!

If you're here for the CS 3410 AEW stuff, [CLICK HERE](cs3410-aew)!


I'm from the Philly, and am going to school in Ithaca, NY.

I am also:
- a member of Cornell Custom Silicon System's digital subteam
- an incoming software engineering intern in program analysis at Semgrep
- an Academic Excellence Workshop facilitator for CS 3410

## Academic Interests
I really like programming languages. I am fortunate to have been exposed to many langauges.  The languages I had learned (in order) are: QuickBASIC 64, Python, Ti-Basic, C++, Java, OCaml, C. Click [here](garden/my-programming-journey) if you want to hear more about my programming language journey. My favorite language honestly changes a lot, but my current favorites are Python, OCaml, and C. My least favorite is Verilog by far, but it might just be a skill issue since I'm still a hardware noob.

I also like digital design. I've been getting destroyed by a course in computer architecture lately, but it is kind of fun.


## Hobbies
I tend to pick up new hobbies and switch around pretty quickly, so I'm kind of an amateur at everything. 

Here are some hobbies I have been going on and off:
- Video games! My favorite games include League of Legends, Xenoblade Chronicles (1/2/3), and also Zelda. Currently, I'm trying to play some more retro games. 
  - I think League of Legends has made me into a better student, read more [here](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school)
- Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- Calisthenics
- Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most
- Running -- I only recently realized that cardio is something important, so I've been trying to run more
