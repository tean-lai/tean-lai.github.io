## **Short version**

Hello, world! I'm Tean.

I am a computer science student, in my last year at <span class="red-text">Cornell</span>.

I am mainly interested in programming languages, systems, and hardware.

My hobbies include calisthenics, bouldering, video games, martial arts, skill toys, and music.

This website is my space to share things.






## **Longer version**

I'm still Tean.

To elaborate a little more on what I'm currently up to with my interests:
- **Bouldering**: Working towards consistently climbing V2.
- **Video games**: I just completed Silksong, and recently started a playthrough on Elden Ring.
- **Martial arts**: Currently learning some Taekwondo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu through school.
- **Programming languages**: My favorites so far are OCaml and Java. I dislike Python. I am looking to try Rust, Go, or some Lisp next.
- **Hardware**: Currently been studying up on systolic array matrix multiplication. Also trying to learn some Hardcaml to work on some RTL side projects.
