## Hi, I'm Tean

I like programming languages and computer microarchitecture. I'm in my senior year of college at Cornell.

To be honest, I'm not quite sure what I want out of this website. To some extent, it feels like I'm just doxxing myself.

But sometimes I do find other people's websites to be inspiring in some way, I feel that it makes the internet much more homely anyways. It feels more like a place with a people, than just endless fronts for corporations.

## Hobbies
I have a variety of hobbies I rotate between:
- Calisthenics
- Bouldering
- Video games
  - My favorite games include the Xenoblade series, Zelda, and the Nier series. Currently, I'm trying to play some more story-driven games.
  - I think League of Legends has made me a better student, [hear me out](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school).
  - My [thoughts on games](garden/my-thoughts-on-games.md) I've played.
- Martial Arts -- currently learning taekwondo and bjj
- Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most.
- Butterfly knife flipping
<!-- - (On)  Running -- I only recently realized that cardio is something important, so I've been trying to run more -->
