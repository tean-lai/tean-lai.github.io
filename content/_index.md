## Hi, I'm Tean

I am a computer scientist interested in programming languages and computer microarchitecture. I'm in my senior year of college at Cornell. Welcome to my website!

Lately been focusing on moral development, whatever that entails.

## Hobbies
I have a variety of hobbies I rotate between:
- Calisthenics
- Bouldering
- Video games
  - My favorite games include the Xenoblade series, Zelda, and the Nier series. Currently, I'm trying to play some more story-driven games.
  - I think League of Legends has made me a better student, [hear me out](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school).
  - My [thoughts on games](garden/my-thoughts-on-games.md) I've played.

- Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most.
