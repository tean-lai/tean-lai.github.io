Hi, I'm Tean. I am a computer scientist interested in compilers, programming languages, and hardware. I'm in my junior year of college at Cornell. Welcome to my website!

Currently, I'm in my junior year at Cornell. I've been involved in PL/formal verification research. I'm also a part of the student-led project team C2S2's digital subteam. We focus on designing and taping out ASICs. Next summer, I will be interning at Semgrep as a part of the program analysis team.

## Academic Interests
I like programming languages. Fun fact: my first programming language was Basic.
I'm also getting more into hardware over time. I find things like Verilog to be pretty interesting since it requires a vastly different way of thinking compared to programming software. 


## Hobbies
I tend to pick up new hobbies and switch around pretty quickly, so I'm kind of an amateur at everything. 

Here are some hobbies I have been going on and off:
- (On)  Calisthenics, recently started bouldering too
- (Off) Video games! My favorite games include the Xenoblade series, Zelda, and the Nier series. Currently, I'm trying to play some more story-driven games.
  - I think League of Legends has made me into a better student, [hear me out](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school).
  - My [thoughts on games](garden/my-thoughts-on-games.md) I've played.
- (Off) Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- (Off) Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most
- Running -- I only recently realized that cardio is something important, so I've been trying to run more
