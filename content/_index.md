Hi, I'm Tean. I am a 3rd year CS major interested in programming languages and hardware. Welcome to my website!

I'm from the suburbs of Philly, and am  going to school in Ithaca, NY.

I am also:
- a member of Cornell Custom Silicon System's digital subteam
- an incoming software engineering intern in program analysis at Semgrep
- an Academic Excellence Workshop facilitator for CS 3410



## Academic Interests
I really like programming languages. I am fortunate to have been exposed to many langauges. In the order of languages I had learned, it would be: QuickBASIC 64, Python, Ti-Basic, C++, Java, OCaml, C. Click [here](garden/my-programming-journey) if you want to hear more about my programming language journey. My favorite language now is OCaml, and sometimes I think I bring up functional programming more than it is healthy.

I also like digital logic. It's honestly kind thinking in a problem domain that involves so much concurrency, but at the same time trying to create some sequential meaning out of it. 


## Hobbies
I tend to pick up new hobbies and drop them pretty quickly, so I'm kind of an amateur at everything. I think that just be who I am though, but I do tend to revisit hobbies, it just comes in phases.

Here are some hobbies I have been going on and off:
- Video games! My favorite games include League of Legends, Xenoblade Chronicles (1/2/3), and also Zelda. Currently, I'm trying to play some more retro games. 
  - I think League of Legends has made me into a better student, read more [here](garden/lol-makes-you-better-at-school)
- Music -- I play both the violin and guitar!
- Calisthenics
- Yoyos -- I enjoy 1a and 2a the most
- Running -- I only recently realized that cardio is something important, so I've been trying to run more
