Hello, world! I'm Tean.

I am a computer science student, in my last year at <span class="red-text">Cornell</span>.

I am mainly interested in programming languages, systems, and hardware.

My hobbies include calisthenics, bouldering, video games, martial arts, skill toys, and music.

This website is where share things about me.
