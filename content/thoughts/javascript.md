# On JavaScript
To be honest, I've only done a little bit of programming in JavaScript. It seems like a good language. As a functional programming enthusiast, I like how functional it is, especially compared to Python. Honestly, I probably would have preffered if JavaScript was popular in the domains Python is currently. Honestly, I have no idea why that is the case. I heard Python's object system supposedly interacts well with everything, but I can't imagine anything beating the universality of JavaScript objects, after all, JSON files must be extremely popular for a reason.

I think as a scripting language it's great, but I think it's a shame the web is powered by it. I'd be chill with it if was only for small dynamic elements, but these days it's literally been milked to death.
