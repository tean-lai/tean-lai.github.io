I fear pain. While I think I can tolerate pain somewhat well due to experiencing arthritis, I fear it nonetheless.

I'm not sure if I fear death, but I fear dying.

Recently, in the summer of 2025, I had ended up in the emergency room because I had a stomach obstruction, which basically meant food and liquids would stay stuck in my stomach. One of the early things I was told, was that I might have to go through surgery. In my life, I've had 5+ surgeries, non of them were major, but I was familiar with the process. I thought I would be comfortable with the pain that followed. But the first time, I felt dread in the idea of surgery. I realized I actually *feared* the pain that followed. I feared the painful recovery process.

I don't know if my fear of pain is something I can get over.

I have a feeling like this is something humans shouldn't be able to get over. Pain is a warning against danger, after all. If that's the case, maybe it's not worth struggling over and just accept it as it is.
