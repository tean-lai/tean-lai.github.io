One of my guilty pleasures, is the love for drama.

I try to avoid being the center of drama, but when drama happens, and I get to be a bystander, EVEN if I know the drama is bad, I can't help but feel excited.

To me, drama is like puzzles. They could happen because of something specific about how the people involved work. Like maybe a particular person has anger issues. Or maybe a person had experienced this one particular thing in their past, causing something in the present to be an unexpected trigger. Dramas highlight the presence of human puzzles, and I love puzzles.

But is this right? To treat humans as mere puzzles? I would think not. In a sense, this is an objectification of humanity.

In thepast, I have "solved" puzzles in my head, but then proceed to do nothing to resolve the drama itself.

It's not something I want to keep doing, and this is one flaw in my character I'm trying to work on.

At a minimum, if I can "solve" such puzzles, trying to resolve the drama with my answers would be one way to verify if they are right.
