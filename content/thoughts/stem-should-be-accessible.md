# Focusing on STEM is making STEM less accessible

STEM is a bit of a buzzword lately. STEM is an acronym for Science Technology Engineering Math.

There are many initiatives, focusing on making STEM as a whole more accessible to a wider audience. While I think this is a noble cause, I think it's not very money-efficient.

That's because there is a huge divide in how expensive it is to expose a child to the different categories of STEM.

## Science is expensive

Equipping a school to be able to provide a good science education means lots of money investing in science labs, and a large amount of science equipment. You would need these for students to run experiments on. This is all quite expensive. The worst part is that all these science things can only be done in school essentially. It's hard to run many experiments at home without the proper equipment.

## Technology is expensive

Some schools offer laptops to every student, but that costs a lot of money. Good technology education also means students need good access to internet and power. This can cause accessibility issues.

## Engineering is hard to teach youngsters

Engineering lowkey requires a ton of math as pre-requisites, and lots of analysis skills. Some engineering skills can be developed, but this usually requires expensive equipment too. For example, robotics might be a good way to train engineering skills, but robotics kits are quite expensive.

## Math is what we should focus on

Math is cheap.

The only thing you need really, is the ability to read, an understanding of basic logic, and a lot of time.

With a good foundation of math, you could become a good engineer, you could become great at tech.

People with a math background pick up computer science very quick.

People with a math background can pick up physics quite quick.

I can't really say for sure how quickly they pick up sciences other than physics, but I could imagine the top of thinking transfers over quite well.
