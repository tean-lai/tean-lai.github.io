# Critical thinking is no longer expected

The U.S. has been treating science in a strange way in recent years.

Science is almost regarded as a religion, where only certain preacher-like people have are allowed to preach.

If you're just a normal person, making claims that falls under the domain of science, then you can be silenced for misinformation.

## Misinformation is only dangerous due to lack of critical thinking

Misinformation can undoubtedly be dangerous. But it's mostly dangerous to those who do not critically think. If you accept every piece of information without reason, you're gullible and a fool. Sadly, the higher powers of the country thinks Americans are gullible and fools, thus misinformation must be silenced no matter what.

But if you gave a critical thinker misinformation, they are less likely to accept it. They still might, because critical thinking sometimes can't be used in regards to political topics, there is some research on this supposedly.

It's a shame.

## The solution to misinformation is not silencing it

Silencing misinformation can address the symptoms. But it does not solve the issue. The root cause is because of the shitty American education system. If you have a shit education system, it's no surprise critical thinking isn't where it should be.

However, no politician seems to be really addressing the low-hanging fruit of what causes the American education system to be so shit.
