You can control how you react to things. It's not like rage can give you any strength in a debate.

Wrath is also a sin. Exercise some patience.

By my nature, I fall easy to ragebait. I've already improved substantially though, but there are a ways to go.

I'm also silly proud of this note just because it's kinda meta. In the sense it is ragebait itself.
