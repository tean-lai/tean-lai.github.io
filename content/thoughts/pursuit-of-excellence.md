## Pursuit of excellence

I think this is a valuable pursuit.

It seems that excellence in a specific domain matters less than having achieved excellence.

Think of PhDs, many don't end up researching their thesis topic. But it was the process of getting their PhD that made them into strong researchers.

My theory is that to achieve excellence in anything, it seems that you have to overcome many internal struggles. Through overcoming such trials, it becomes easier to achieve excellence in anything else.
