## Navigating toxic friendships

It's not fun when friendships become toxic.

I used to think the answer to toxic relationships were to just cut people off.

But lately I've been thinking this isn't the only way. I think the key is distance management.

My hypothesis is that every relationship can become toxic, if you are too close. For some relationships, you might have to get REALLY close, while for others, you might not have to get very close at all. The point is, this distance is very dependent on the people in the relationship.

But how to go about finding the right amount of distance? This is likely a very personal thing. The quickest way is likely some form of [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search). But I prefer to not to do that method, because it's easy to land on the danger zone of closeness. I prefer to stay on the "safe side" and slowly inch over until I find the most comfortable distance.

I think it's analogous to Icarus flying too close to the sun. There was a maximum height for him to fly, but he shouldn't find out by flying too high first, and dropping down. He should've slowly inched himself up.

But there's probably also something to be said about not going too far up.
