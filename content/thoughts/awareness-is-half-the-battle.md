## Achieving awareness is half the battle


Applies in many ways

- Being aware of the right problems to solve. Many people can solve problems. But not many people know the best problems to solve. This requires awareness.
- Living up to your values is important, but having SET good values is also very important. What if you set the wrong values but live up to them? Would you prefer that, then having the right set of values, but occassionally falling short? This requires awareness.
