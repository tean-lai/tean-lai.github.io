## Vim sorta makes me more productive

I've spent a shit ton of time on Vim/Neovim configs at this point, as well as hopping between different text editors like Emacs and Helix.

I don't think anything I've saved nearly enough time through clever keybindings that would make up for the lost time, and won't do so for a long time.

But I still think these kinds of text editors have made me more productive in some way.

I simply find these things fun to tinker around with, and whatever keeps me engaged with software is good, because I just end up spending more time with software overall.
