title = "Teenage arthritis"

I am officially diagnosed with enthesitis-related arthritis. This means my ligaments get inflamed and cause joint pain. If it's unmanaged, it could cause my joints to fuse. Thankfully, I am now taking medication, specifically Humira, which treats it quite well. In my current life, I don't experience much joint pain. However, in the first several years of having arthritis, it was not treated adequately, and it greatly shaped how I view the world.

## My first months with an invisible and uncommon condition

When I was in 8th grade, I was in track and field. Joint pain started very suddenly, manifesting as slight hip pain when I ran.

I thought it would go away within a couple of days, but it never did. It only got worse, affecting me when I walked, and spreading to other joints.

The tricky part was trying to talk to my classmates about such pain. Some responses I had were, "Oh, I have some pain sometimes, but usually it goes away!". But it would've been unlikely they could relate. Thankfully, most young people don't have similar experiences, but that left me with no easily accessible peers for this kind of suffering.

I told my parents I had some pain going on, but it wasn't severe enough that my parents would be alarmed. I didn't talk about my pain for several months, and later they had told me that they assumed the pain had stopped.

I didn't know WHO to talk to. At that point, I knew no one in my life that had gone through a similar experience. I felt lonely.

I didn't *want* to go around telling everyone that I was in pain, but at the same time, I desperately wanted to, to feel seen. Even if I told people, if I acted fine enough, people tended to forget. At the same time, I didn't want to make it my life, but it was a very big part of my life at the moment. The disconnect in how the world saw me, and how I experienced the world continued to grow.

**Internal pain had borne a variety of additional internal struggles.**

But I did realize that many people likely had struggles no one else can see. If you don't share your struggles, it's hard for others to know. But if you do share them, chances are much higher you will find people to support you.

No one was unkind to me when I shared my struggles, it just wasn't something they could relate to. But the compassion they gave me helped me get along.

## 1st stage of grief: denial
To be honest, I did believe my pain would go away eventually. I was young, I must be healthy, right?

## Getting an accurate diagnosis for something uncommon is non-trivial

Who would have thought?

After a year or so, I had started bugging my mom to take me to see a doctor. I started to feel less convinced that my pain would eventually go away.
<!-- TODO: link story when it's written -->

The first doctor I went to diagnosed me with trochanteric bursitis. It was an acute pain that affected runners fairly often, and he told me I could be treated through physical therapy. Since it was a non-medicine route, my mom was very much in favor of this route.

**Physical therapy is really expensive.**

After several months of sessions, it didn't seem like it was working. Those months also cost us thousands of dollars. The doctor had recommended me to take some medication, but my mom was very much against this.

She took me to another doctor, and he was like "Why not just take the medicine like the other doctor says??? I'm giving you the same diagnosis." This is not verbatim, but it conveys how he was.

The cruel irony was finding out months later that he was also wrong.

Eventually, I started seeing doctors at CHOP, the Children's Hospital at Philadelphia. They tested me more extensively, using MRIs, and overall collecting a lot more information. They had finally given me the diagnosis of *enthesitis-related arthritis*.

**Having an accurate diagnosis gave me comfort.**

Before, I had concerns that my pain was "all in my head". But having a label on things helped me much feel better, even though no real treatment has been done yet!

I felt validated in having my struggles acknowledged. The pain was real.

But the diagnosis came with another issue: it was a chronic condition with no known cure. It was also the case that the best treatments all required medications that often came with warnings like "may increase the risk of cancer" or "can cause tuberculosis to be fatal". My parents were also not big fans of western medicine. While they would financially support me with the medication, and allow me to take it, I knew it would cause them great emotional pain. For context, I think they are traumatized from me having cancer at a younger age, but that's another story for another time.

In the end, I postponed taking medications like Enbrel and Humira, opting to try weaker medications and exploring alternative medicine, like acupuncture for a duration of time.

## 2nd stage of grief: anger

At a certain point, I started to get quite frustrated.

**Why did I develop arthritis, when no one I knew of the same age did the same?**
**Why me?**

I couldn't help feel that maybe karma existed in this world, and maybe it was due to that. Maybe I committed a ton of crimes in my previous life or something.

**I wanted to grasp for a reason why this was happening at all.**

## 3rd stage of grief: bargaining

If I had a reason for why I had arthritis, I thought maybe I could have a solution, if I could fight the reason.

The medical system told me it was impossible, so my cope was that it must have been caused by something divine.

Maybe if I was a better person, it could go away.

## 4th stage of grief: depression

For a period of time, I was in a state of despair. The pain was getting worse, spreading to my knees and shoulders, and more hip joints. I had quit track. It also became harder to play the violin. I couldn't play guitar either, and that used to be one of my emotional outlets.

I felt like a defective human being.

I lost hope in looking for a romantic partner. I couldn't feel as if I could be good enough. I wouldn't even be able to take a girl around an amusement park.

I lost ambition in school and in my work. What was the point of investing in your future, when you didn't want to live in the future?

I wanted to be pain free, that was one of things that I wanted most. Things like money and status lost meaning to me. A good life to me started to mean freedom. Freedom to move how you wish, to do what you want to do. Freedom from a constant barrage of pain.

**Money and status stopped mattering to me, and health and freedom became some of my core values.**

It was weird though. I didn't want to live, but I didn't want to die either. For one, my death would've meant extreme pain for my parents, and I didn't want to be one to inflict such pain on others.

## 5th stage of grief: acceptance

Thankfully, acceptance eventually comes.

**When you get things taken from you, you start paying attention to what you still have.**

You can get your wallet stolen, but when you finally accept you're not getting the money back, you focus on what money you still have.

After a certain point, I paid a lot more attention to things I still had around. I even started being grateful for air conditioning.

Practicing gratitude saved me. My life was still very much abundant. I found joy in just living for the sake of living.


## Why I still started taking medication

It feels hyprocritical, taking stronger medication despite feeling I attained "acceptance".

But the pain continued to become more unbearable. And the prospects of joints potentially fusing did not help. I also did not want to be physically dependent on relatives for the rest of my life.

While I believe I have achieved comfort with arthritis at an emotional level, it still had physical consequences, and it was important to me to try to manage that.


## One bonus benefit

While I had found a lot of anguish in going through health struggles without many others to relate to. At this point, my peers are slowly starting to catch up with health problems, sadly.

It does provide me some comfort knowing that I can provide some support in some ways that was unavailable to me. They still have to go through the majority of the struggles themselves, but I hope they find comfort in knowing they are not alone.

And even back then, I wasn't completely alone. I did start journeying onto Reddit, where you can find communities of people going through very similar issues.
