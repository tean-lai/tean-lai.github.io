## Why I chose against having a professional focus

There was a glaring option to center my website around my professional experiences and development.

Resumes can't convey your full professional journey, so having a website can be a very useful supplement. It can fill in the gaps between the bullet points. You get an opportunity to practice "show, don't tell".

I don't think many people would find value in knowing about what programming languages I've worked with at a surface level, for example. But more people might care what I think about certain languages, many likely won't though, but that's okay.

But even if my goal was to attract a job, I wouldn't want to center this site on professional things. I want to work with people with good characters. Tech-stack is irrelevant for that, and I would rather focus my website on who I am as a person.

## I think people should share their thoughts and experiences

## I took a course on professional website development

As one of my engineering degree's requirements, I had to take a communications course. I could take a variety of courses to fulfill this requirement, and I chose one that centered around developing professional websites.

In this course, we would analyze other engineers' portfolio websites. The websites that I felt drawn to the most were ones where the engineers would talk a lot about their internal thoughts, or when they share what other cool things they might be up to, like art. I find it fascinating to see who people are beyond their professional career.

This course also inspired me to be more intentional on what I want this site to be about, and to be more intentional about what I want to communicate to the internet.

## Why I want this site to be minimal

I try to use little JavaScript in this website.

There are several reasons for this. For one, not interested in front-end development. At some point, I would like to know how it works at a high level, but it is low on my curiosity list.

But I also have a distaste at how wasteful we are being with technology. JavaScript is one of the most expensive languages to run, and we run so much of it via the web.

I want this site to feel snappy.

It's still possible to make sites look aesthetically appealing with minimal JavaScript.

<!-- I believe that we should work with computers as they are, not what we think they are. They are not just abstract machines, but concrete machines that take resources to operate. Different abstractions require different amounts of resources, and I want to be mindful of such resource-usage when choosing which abstractions to use. This is more a general statement, not trying to shame JavaScript users in particular. With JavaScript, there are many things you can build that are much harder to do otherwise, and there is value in building such things too. -->

## Using a static site generator

Static site generators are nice because it frees me from needing to think much about HTML and CSS. They raise the abstraction level for website development, without being too far out of my control like other website builders.

I want my website to be primarily static content, so this works well.

It's easy to create reusable CSS too. To be fair, I don't know if it's just as easy with raw HTML and CSS, but I anticipate that not being the case.

It's also quite performant.

As for why Hugo in particular? It was one of the first ones I found, and it seemed quite popular and it works. I haven't encountered any issues so far.
