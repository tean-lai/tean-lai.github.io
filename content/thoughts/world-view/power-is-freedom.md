I'm convinced that power translates to freedom, and vice versa.

Some common types of power:
- Financial power -- you have a lot of money
- Political power -- you have powerful allies
- Physical power -- you can physically overwhelm others

There are definitely more that I just have listed.

But the point is to highlight some examples.

Financial power has a big effect on freedom. If you're broke, you need to trade your time away to make ends meet. Being wealthy means you are more free with your time. In addition to that, you have access to more activities due to being able to overcome cost barriers.

Making more money means you can buy more of your time back.


If you have political power, you are able to speak more freely without consequences.

If you lack physical power, there are less things you can do. There are more places you should avoid, and where you can go is much more sensitie on the time of day (or night).
