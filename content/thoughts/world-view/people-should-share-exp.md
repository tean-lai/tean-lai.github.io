title = "People should share their thoughts and experiences"

Life is short. Time is one of the biggest limiters in our lives. We just don't have enough time to think of everything, or to experience everything.

We ought to share more of our own lived experiences with each other, so we can artifically extend our lives. If I hear the life stories of 4 other people, I could maybe "expand" my life by 4 more times! Disclaimer: that was not real math, please don't get mad at me.

I have thoughts... and I have experiences. I think I should share them.

I find that it's quite easy to feel lonely in life, when you don't feel as if others can relate to your perspective. I felt this particularly with [my experience with arthritis](../teenage-arthritis). I think one way to relieve this is by hearing more perspectives that are similar. Seeing people in similar situations on Reddit saved my soul. Maybe my experiences can provide others comfort in some way.

Acquiring other people's experiences is probably the most efficient way to expand your world view.
