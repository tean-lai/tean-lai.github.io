If one has sufficient critical thinking, misinformation is less effective. They are more able to discern what is likely to be true and untrue.

It doesn't always mean they are always right in their judgement.

These days, I think there is a dangerous idea being spread around that "misinformation should be censored". It was common for information to be censored on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The practice of censorship "misinformation" leaves information to be judged by a select class of people, when it should be everyone's right to judge what to be true.

To truely protect the people, we should ought to focus on developing better critical thinking as a whole. That's the solution that helps us all move forward. The censorship route may work in helping people not move backwards, but I find the former solution to have a more appealing outcome, despite it being harder to implement.
