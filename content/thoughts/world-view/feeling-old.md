title = "What makes people feel old?"

The older I get, the more same my mind feels.

I've heard from an admittedly small sample of adults that their minds "feel half their age".

I'm going to overgeneralize and say that people don't feel older due to the passage of time, but instead **due to their weakening bodies**.

When you can no longer play the same sports you used to, that's when you realize "I'm old."

When you can no longer wipe your own poo, you realize "I'm old".

When you can't walk without assistance, "I'm old".

The only real way for me to verify this is true is by surveying a ton more old people, need to increase that sample size.
