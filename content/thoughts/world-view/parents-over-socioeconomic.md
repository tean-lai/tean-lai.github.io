title = "Good parents trump socioeconomic privilege"

These days, there is a lot of talk about wealth inequality, and different class divides, especially in the U.S.

While I think those are big problems, I don't think socioeconomic status is the biggest influence in people's outcome in life.

It's parents.

## Is "good" parenting subjective?

Not really, there are several aspects of parenting where there is a "good" way to do.

### Parenting style

The **authrotative parenting style** is considered the best one, out of permissive, authoritative, neglectful, and authrotarian.

### Attachment styles

The **secure attachment style** is considered the best one, out of secure, anxious, avoidant, and fearful.

## Moral development

Parents can also be role models for good character development. Whether we like it or not, many of us end up modeling our parents in some way.

Children who get bullied by their parents are more likely to be bullies themselves.

Children who get abused by their parents are more likely to abuse their children.

Some of this is related to attachment styles, but the fact remains that parents have a big impact on moral development.

Arguably, I would prefer having some better moral development to having some better socioeconomic status.

## Coping skills

Part of having a comfortable life is being able to handle uncomfortable situations. I believe parents have a large impact on a child's ability to cope with the world.
