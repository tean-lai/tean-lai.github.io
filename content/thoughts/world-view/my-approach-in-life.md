# How I want to live my life

- Fail fast. Fail often. Don't repeat failures.
  - I used to avoid failures because I thought it signaled I was untalented. But ["talent" is an illusion anyways](../illusion-of-talent).
- Don't work hard. Work smart or play hard.
- No to golden rule: "Treat others how you wish to be treated". 
  - Instead, yes to platinum rule: "Treat others how they wish to be treated".
  - In the past, I used to say rude things to people, which I thought was okay because I knew I could tolerate it if the same things were said to me. I now think it's unfair to treat people this way.
- Take time to listen to people. Listening is not the same as hearing.
- Tackle the 7 deadly sins. Don't avoid them.
- Focus on what you want, not on what might stop you.
  - Knowing obstacles are important, but don't focus on them.
  - Ex: Good skiiers focus on the path to go, not on what trees to avoid.
