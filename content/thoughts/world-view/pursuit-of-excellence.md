title = "The true value in pursuing excellence"
+++

I don't think it actually matters in what you are excellent in. The thing that matters is the experience in achieving excellence.

Think of PhDs, many don't end up directly researching their thesis topic, but remain valuable researchers regardless. It was the process of getting their PhD that made them into valuable researchers.

**My hypothesis:** To achieve excellence in anything, you have to overcome many internal struggles. Through overcoming such trials, it becomes easier to achieve excellence in anything else.

Implications of this:
- Excellence in "silly" pursuits is valuable, even if no direct value is provided to society.
- If you can afford to, pursue excellence in things you find interesting, this might be a faster way to achieve excellence in something you don't care about.
