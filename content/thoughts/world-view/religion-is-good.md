These days, much less people are religious, especially in the U.S.

Probably because people believe in science more, they doubt the existence of God.

80% of the value of religion is just telling you to do good. Whether or not higher beings actually exist might not matter too much.

But it might if you are operating with preconventional morality or something.

Otherwise, religion provides a fairly good moral compass in my opinion, which I think is hard for people to set themselves unlses they had really good role models in their life.
