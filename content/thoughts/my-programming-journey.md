# My programming language journey

## Quick Basic 64, my first language
It might be a cliche, but my programming journey began when I felt the desire to build my own video games. However, I didn't know much about programming, so I went and bought the first programming book I could find on the Kindle store. That is how my first language came to be QuickBASIC 64 (QB64). My 5th grade self wasn't able to get far into the book, but I was able to make the silly text based adventure games. I don't know why such an obscure language was easily searchable through the Kindle store though, I think Amazon might have had some seriously week algorithms before. 

## Python
Eventually, I had learned about more sensible languages. One of my friend's dad happened to be a programmer, so I discovered Python and had studied it for a bit.

But I didn't spend too much time on Python. My biggest priority was going to school, so I ended up learning Ti-Basic, so I could program my calculator to allow me to cheese through math and science as much as possible. It was a lot fun. My experiences with QB64 was strangely useful, and I developed a lot of bad programming practices using Goto as one of my primary ways of control flow. It does make me cringe a little now, but there weren't many better options within Ti-Basic. I find it crazy that modern calculators come with Python now. However, I am proud of a few programs from this era. In particular, there was a platformer I had made. But the things I am most proud of is how I ended up optimizing it. I had used a lot of optimizations that logically made no sense, but improved my performance a lot. I now think those optimizations were likely cache optimizations under the hood. In general, it seems that learning Ti-Basic had greatly set up the foundations for understanding assembly.

## C++
After Ti-Basic, I picked up C++, since it's probably the best language for competitive programming. I can't say I code well, because I had used a lot of competitive-programming idioms, which can sometimes be elegant but sometimes unreadable. 

## Java
After that, I studied Java because of AP Computer Science A and also my first semester computing course CS 2110 at college.

## OCaml
But the best part is afterwards, when I took CS 3110 and was exposed to one of my favorite languages, OCaml!
