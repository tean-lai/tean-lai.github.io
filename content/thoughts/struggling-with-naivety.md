# Struggling with naivety

I am young.

I have experiences, but there are many experiences I don't have.

How can I trust my own judgement in this world when I know there is a lot I don't know?

This is one of my current struggles at the moment.

I'm still in my young 20s, I'm still years off from having kids, I'm not fully financially responsible for myself.

At the current moment, a lot of my judgement is a fusion of my own, in addition to judgement of people whom I respect immensely, like my parents and other mentors in my life.

I don't know if this is the right kind of thinking, or I should have judgement that is completely my own.
