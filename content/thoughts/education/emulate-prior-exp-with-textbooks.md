title = "Emulate prior experience with different textbooks"

One of the reasons some students do much better than others in a course has to do with differences in prior experience with the subject.

This occurs often in math courses, where a decent chunk of students be advantaged due to competition math experience.

This also occurs often in computer science courses, where some students have been programming for years prior to college, while others are doing so for the first time.

I've always wondered about how one can efficiently overcome such knowledge gaps.

Part of it is spending more time to compensate for the lack of experience. I think this component matters.

But I think another component that matters is that **prior experience often comes with different perspectives**. I strongly believe having multiple mental models at your disposal is key to being a good problem solver.

When you learn a topic under different instructors, it's possible to pick up different perspectives on a topic.

So even if you try to compensate for inexperience with more time, I think you ought to consider doing such with different perspectives. One way to do so is by reading textbooks by different authors. For math courses, I often read books on the same topic, but by a different author. Different explanations are sometimes provided, and topics are presented in different orders, giving you a variety of approaches to problems. I find that this immensely strengthens my foundations in a topic.

It doesn't have to be just textbooks, but they just tend to have higher-quality information. The key is to acquire more perpsectives.
