## Transfer of learning

I feel like rarely anyone talks about transfer of learning, I've certainly never heard of it mentioned in school.

Transfer of learning, according to Wikipedia, "occurs when people apply information, strategies, and skills they have learned to a new situation or context."

It's weird no one talks about it because of how big the consequences are if you master this skill.

It could be argued that the main purpose of education is to have that learning be transferred elsewhere. Often, people don't work a job directly related to what they studied in school. But if the learning was not transferred, they might as well not have gone through that education!

My thoughts on this topic is mainly a reflection of my own experiences, and not of deep research.

There is that story of physics students, who were tested on physics problems in a format they are not used to, and their performance tanked significantly.

To me, it seems that high transfer of learning CAN come from deep mastery of something. For example, if you have a deep mastery of mathematics, physics and computer science is likely much easier to pick up.

But the main takeaways is that I think that people should be tryharding school when they can. Grades are not the most important thing in the world, but they do correlate with good mastery of content. People should be seeking mastery as opposed to just passing, because it makes the difference between a class being useful to being completely useless.
