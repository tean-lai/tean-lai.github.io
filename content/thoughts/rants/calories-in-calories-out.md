title = "It's not just calories in calories out"

I find this to be a common sentiment amongst body builders, but when the topic of weight-gain or weight-loss is brought up around them, they often say "it's just calories in calories out.". They claim it's just that simple, that it's just a matter of willpower.

But is it just that simple?

Due to a variety of factors, **people burn different amount of calories** for one reason or another. Through the same diet, individuals of similar height or weight can have different weight outcomes.

Calories out are also not just calories burned, it **doesn't account for poo**.

100 calories of apples cannot be the same as 100 calories of coke, even though the sugar is the main source of calories for both of these foods.
