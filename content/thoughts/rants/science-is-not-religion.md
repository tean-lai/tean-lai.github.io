But why does the U.S. keeping treating it as such?

We have a class of experts who essentially act as preachers.

Many people online get censored for spreading misinformation, which I think is [only a problem due to low critical thinking](../world-view/misinformation-and-critical-thinking). It's like being deemed heretics.

I think the typical person should listen to such experts, but they should be allowed to challenge them as well. Our current society does not seem to allow for that.
