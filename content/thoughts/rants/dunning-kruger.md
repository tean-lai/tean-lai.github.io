There is some slight irony in that I'm going to define the Dunning-Kruger effect in case you haven't heard of it.

According to Wikipedia, "the Dunning-Kruger effect is as cognitive bias that describes the systematic tendency of people with low ability in a specific area to give overly positive assessments of this ability".

A summary of the effect goes like this:
1. First you gain some competence, and your confidence spikes. This is the "peak of mount stupid", since you have high confidence, but you don't know what you don't know.
2. Next, you realize how much you don't know, and your confidence dips. This is called the "valley of despair".
3. Next, you start learning more about the things you don't know, your confidence rises again, and you are on the "slope of enlighment".
4. Lastly, you know what you know, and know what you don't know, your confidence is high but you're actually competent, and you have reached the "plateau of sustainability".

Even if you may not have heard of the specific term "Dunning-Kruger", I feel that many people would find this concept somewhat intuitive. Many people dive into their interests, and come to realize how much they don't know. I could be wrong about how common it is. I believe that it's mainly just be the formalization that's uncommon.

The tricky thing is that it's hard to know when you are out of mount stupid. Mount stupid is probably a stupid squiggly graph or something.

The following is not a generalization of people, but a commentary on a couple of people I've interacted with in my life. Why do they act as if they know when someone is in mount stupid? It's silly. I think it goes like this:
1. Person A is aware of Dunning-Kruger, so mount stupid for them probably looks more like just low confidence.
2. Person A has low confidence, and tends to be in "valley of despair" or earlier.
3. For some reason, Person A can't imagine their peers being further ahead of them.
4. Person A sees Person B, who is more confident. The only conclusions to them are:
    - If Person A is in the valley of despair, B must be in mount stupid.
    - If Person A is in the valley of despair, B might be slightly ahead, but still in mount stupid. Person A thinks Person B must simply be overconfident and unaware of their own unawareness.
5. In either case, Person B can easily already be in the "slope of enlightenment", and be starting to develop confidence in what they do know.

Now, the tricky thing about this analysis is that I don't know what I don't know. And this entire post can be completely ironic, LOL.
