## Why I chose against having a professional focus

There was a glaring option to center my website around my professional experiences and development.

Resumes can't convey your full professional journey, so having a website can be a very useful supplement. It can fill in the gaps between the bullet points. You get an opportunity to practice "show, don't tell".

I don't think many people would find value in knowing about what programming languages I've worked with at a surface level, for example. But more people might care what I think about certain languages, many likely won't though, but that's okay.

But even if my goal was to attract a job, I wouldn't want to center this site on professional things. I want to work with people with good characters. Tech-stack is irrelevant for that, and I would rather have my website convey that I am not *that* bad of a person.

## Why I think people should share their thoughts and experiences

Life is short. Time is one of the biggest limiters in our lives. We just don't have enough time to think of everything, or to experience everything.

We ought to share more of our own lived experiences with each other, so we can artifically extend our lives. If I hear the life stories of 4 other people, I could maybe "expand" my life by 4 more times! Disclaimer: that was not real math, please don't get mad at me.

I have thoughts... and I have experiences. I want to share them.

I find that it's quite easy to feel lonely in life, when you don't feel as if others can relate to your perspective. I think one way to relieve this is by hearing more perspectives that are similar. Maybe my perspective will align with some visitor of this page, and can alleviate some loneliness.

Even if my perspective doesn't align, it could serve some use by providing alternative perspectives in life.

## I took a course on professional website development

As one of my engineering degree's requirements, I had to take a communications course. I could take a variety of courses to fulfill this requirement, and I chose one that centered around developing professional websites.

In this course, we would analyze other engineers' portfolio websites. The websites that I felt drawn to the most were ones where the engineers would talk a lot about their internal thoughts, or when they share what other cool things they might be up to, like art. I find it fascinating to see who people are beyond their professional career.

This course also inspired me to be more intentional on what I want this site to be about, and to be more intentional about what I want to communicate to the internet.

## Why I want this site to be minimal

I try to use little JavaScript in this website.

There are several reasons for this. For one, not interested in front-end development. At some point, I would like to know how it works at a high level, but it is low on my curiosity list.

But I also have a distaste at how wasteful we are being with technology. JavaScript is one of the most expensive languages to run, and we run so much of it via the web.

I want this site to feel snappy.

It's still possible to make sites look aesthetically appealing with minimal JavaScript.

<!-- I believe that we should work with computers as they are, not what we think they are. They are not just abstract machines, but concrete machines that take resources to operate. Different abstractions require different amounts of resources, and I want to be mindful of such resource-usage when choosing which abstractions to use. This is more a general statement, not trying to shame JavaScript users in particular. With JavaScript, there are many things you can build that are much harder to do otherwise, and there is value in building such things too. -->
