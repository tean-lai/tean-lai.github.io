# On deciding what to make my personal website about

I didn't have an easy time thinking about what this site should be about.

## Why I chose against having a professional focus

There was a glaring option to center my website around my professional experiences and development.

Resumes can't convey your full professional journey, so having a website can be a very useful supplement. It can fill in the gaps between the bullet points. You could show, and not tell about the things you've done.

I don't think many people would find value in knowing about what programming languages I've worked with at a surface level, for example. But more people might care what I think about certain languages, many likely won't though, but that's okay.

But even if my goal was to attract a job, I wouldn't want to center this site on professional things. I want to work with people with good characters. Tech-stack is irrelevant for that, and I would rather have my website convey that I am not *that* bad of a person.

## I think people should share their thoughts and experiences

Life is short. Time is one of the biggest limiters in our lives. We just don't have enough time to think of everything, or to experience everything.

We ought to share more of our own lived experiences with each other, so we can artifically extend our lives. If I hear the life stories of 4 other people, I could maybe "expand" my life by 4 more times! Disclaimer: that was not real math, please don't get mad at me.

I have thoughts... and I have experiences. I want to share them. I think I could enrich some people's lives, so I'll do what I can.

## I took a course on professional website development

As one of my engineering degree's requirements, I had to take a communications cousre. I could take a variety of courses to fulfill this requirement, and I chose one that centered around developing professional websites.

In this course, we would analyze other engineers' portfolio websites. The websites that I felt drawn to the most, where ones where the engineers would talk a lot about their internal thoughts, or when they share what other cool things they might be up to, like art. I knew they were engineers, but I didn't know who they were. And it was fascinating to find out who they were, and how their opinions on life were similar or different from my own.

But this course did inspire me to be more intentional on what I want this site to be about, and to be more intentional about what I want to communicate to the internet.

## Why I want this site to be minimal

As of writing this page, I use very minimal JavaScript in this website.

There are several reasons for this. For one, I'm not strong in front-end development, nor do I have much interest in learning about it. At some point, I would like to know how it works, but it is not high on my curiosity list.

But I also have a distaste at how wasteful we are being with technology. JavaScript is one of the most expensive languages to run, and we run so much of it via the web.

I don't want this page to be bloated. Less bloated pages have the benefit of making it more accessible to devices with lower computing potential. It also lowers energy and network demands.

It's still possible to make sites look aesthetically appealing with minimal JavaScript.

I believe that we should work with computers as they are, not what we think they are. They are not just abstract machines, but concrete machines that take resources to operate. Different abstractions require different amounts of resources, and I want to be mindful of such resource-usage when choosing which abstractions to use
