TLDR; Seems like throughout history, there are many great ideas. But in order for these ideas to propagate to the mainstream, for some reason it always needs to lose its nuance.

## "Calories in, calories out"
This phrase is generally used by gym bros (and gals) who describe how weight gain/loss works. The idea is that if you want to gain weight (i.e. muscle mass), you need to ingest more calories than you burn, and if you want to lose weight, do the opposite.

But many of these gym bros only see this calorie equation as some two variable addition equation, when weight shenanigans have SO many factors. The simplest example is shitting. No one seems to ever talk about what you shit as a part of the calories out equation. And 50 calories in is extremely different depending on what form it comes in.

## "There can't be more than 2 genders! Biology says there is only XX and XY!"
Actual hivemind take. Even high school biology will tell you that shit like XYY can happen, and all sorts of random shit. Now, I understand not everyone might have access to education to learn this, but you should know if you don't know biology. It's just crazy how many people say these things with such conviction.
