This list is not exhaustive.

**Children first.** I'm immensely grateful they always put their children first, that being me and my brother. In no point in my life had I been neglected, and this is a privilege I want to grant my children.

Everything was always us first. At some point when I was young, we had moved to China temporarily. My parents had a higher income too and it was financially more comfortable there, but ultimately they chose to move back to the states because they thought there were better prospects here for the children.

My parents didn't hang out with friends often. I just thougt they had no friends. But over time I realize how many friends just drifted apart from them, because they were completely focused on family instead.

One of them always worked night shift, so that they could tend to us during the day. My Mom did this for a long time, but my Dad did this for a time too.

**"I love you."** There is never any hesitation for them to tell us they love us. They did show love through their actions as well. But it never felt bad to hear the obvious.

**"As long as you tried your best."** My parents never placed pressure on me to do well in school or anything. My Mom in particular was happy as long as we tried our best. My Dad on the other hand, didn't mind if I tried my best or not. This let me get comfortable with failure, because that was always allowed, and ultimately let me grow.

**"As long as you're happy."** I have the freedom to choose what I want to do in life. In part because I have free will, but a large part is due to little friction from my parents. I got to do what I love, get good at I loved, and ultimately get paid for doing what I love.

**We often had family vacations.** My family is fairly middle-class in the US, but we still have a lot of unpaid loans. To my parents, they didn't care. Family vacations are something you can't have all your life. They gifted us many memories. We still have a lot of debt, but I have no qualms about paying it off. Sure, I'm not always the biggest fan of nature, but I still got to experience a lot of the world.

**They positioned well for opportunities.** I think my Mom is particularly good at this. We had to move states while I was in elementary school, but my Mom made sure to find the best school district she could. It paid off immensely in many ways. I also wanted private violin lessons at some point, and although my Mom didn't know many great teachers, she found me a violin camp, that introduced me to my violin teacher, another GOAT in my life. Maybe a lot of luck was involved. But this luck only came after good positioning.

**My Mom is always willing to help people.** She lowkey carries our extended family when it comes to taxes, utilities, even property management. But I see that she will drop her time to help co-workers too, even if they are texting her out of office hours. Naturally, I would just ignore out-of-office requests and am more selfish with my time in general, but seeing my Mom's generosity towards people is inspiring.

**They don't obsess over what other people think.** I think this one is a good one. Both of my parents don't really concern themselves too much with maintaining an image. Their reputation at work is fine because they are competent. It was weird to me to see that a lot of people care quite a bit about what other people think of them.
