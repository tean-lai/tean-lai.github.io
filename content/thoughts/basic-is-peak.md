Disclaimer: I am slightly biased, since QuickBasic64 was my first programming language, and I did programmed often on the Ti-84, which uses Ti-Basic.

I think Basic is a great language to learn if you want to understand computers. These days, people keep saying recommend learning Python or JavaScript first. And while I do think those languages are good to learn relatively early, you don't understand computers as well. There are simply too many abstraction layers. But while assembly is great for understanding computers, it's got an insane learning curve. Basic in comparison, is just a good balance between being simple, but also reflects the internals of a computer.

## Basic has labels and gotos

Labels and gotos are how control flow is implemented by a CPU. However, most programming languages will abstract this away, and you control the flow of a program via loops instead.

I don't think good languages should include labels and gotos in their language.

However, they are good to learn from. Basic includes labels and gotos, which reflects how computers actually work. Loops are an illusion. Learning Basic early can give you an idea of how computing may work without loops.
