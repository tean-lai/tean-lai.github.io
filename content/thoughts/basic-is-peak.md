## Basic is peak for beginners

Slightly biased, since QuickBasic64 was my first language, and I did a shit ton of programming on the Ti-84 back in the day, which uses Ti-Basic.

I think Basic is a very good language to learn if you actually want to understand computers. These days, people keep saying, "learn Python first!", and what not. And while I do think Python is good to learn relatively early, you don't understand computers as well by starting with Python. There are simply too many abstraction layers. But while C is great for understanding computers, it's got an insane learning curve. Basic in comparison, is just a good balance between being simple, but also reflecting the internals of a computer.

Some reasons why Basic is peak:
 - It's got labels and gotos. Sure, these suck for reasoning reasons, they are good because that's what machines actually do. Loops are just an illusion, knowing Python only makes you a delusional programmer until you learn assembly.
