How can I call myself a PL nerd without reviewing languages???

## Ti-Basic
This the language of the Ti-84.

It's extremely slow, but forces you to learn more about computers in order to improve performance. For example, I learned that if statements was slower than arithmetic, this turned out to be true due to microarchitecture.

This language isn't great outside of forcing you to learn things though.

It doesn't have built-in functions which suck. I didn't know about calling conventions when programming on this, but it DID teach me a need for calling conventions. When I finally learned about the topic in college, it was EXTREMELY motivated.

## Python
This language is unavoidable.

I dislike the syntax. It resembles English a little too much for my liking. English has a terrible grammar, why would we ever want to be like that??

Python ecosystem is unbeatable. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't want to bother with the language.

Dynamic type system is too dangerous for me.

I don't think this language should be focused so strongly in education.

## Java
I like this language.

Sure it's verbose, but the type system is really nice.

I don't like the lack support for functional programming.

I like that the exceptions are checked too. I dislike when languages throw unknown exceptions, like OCaml.

This language is good for learning.

It's annoying that it feels like I HAVE to use an IDE for this language though, but Intellij is not so bad. I just get flashbacks to Eclipse every once in a while, I didn't like using that IDE.


## OCaml
I really like this language.

I think it's clean, but I think the best way to use it is to be verbose, which kind of defeats its elegance.

But when writing in a verbose manner, the compiler helps warn you upon refactors, which is very helpful.

The ecosystem is still weak though.

I think the language is amazing to learn for learning about functional programming.

Type system is amazing. Module system is amazing.

I find it extremely ergonomic.
