## Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

At this point, I feel as if many criticisms have been given about this game. I kind of agree with many of them. A lot of elements in this game really doesn't make sense, and it really does feel like a remix of Breath of the Wild, as opposed to being a fully fledged sequel.

Upon seeing how Silksong turned out, this game looks pretty bad as as sequel.

The depths were a cool surprise, but it did feel really repetitive, because it seemed like they only designed for the first couple hours of experience there, and wanted to make sure that where you jumped, you got that experience.

The plot was ass, I acquired the cutscenes in a bad order. I don't want to spoil too many details here, but at a certain point, cutscenes felt extremely pointless, because I already knew too much information about the plot.

## Hollow Knight: Silksong

This game is phenomenol. The movement feels great. The combat is amazing. The world-building is great too. This is an amazing sequel.

The difficulty was tuned so perfectly for me in respect to both combat and platforming that I found the experience amazing. Mileage might vary for others though.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3
Very satisfying sequel to Xenoblade 1 and 2. Combat system is kind of complicated though, I still have no idea how to play optimally. I don't feel like I have the time to figure it out either.

## Factorio
The game feels VERY similar to designing and implementing a CPU. Requires quite a bit of brainpower though, so I don't have the energy to play this game much after I do schoolwork. I think this might be a good game to have kids play if you want to trick them into accidently learning engineering principles if you're into that though...

## Nier Automata
This game was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Everything about it just felt really well-made. The music was good, the gameplay was very smooth. The themes were very thought-provoking. I was lucky enough to go into this game with near-zero knowledge of the game, and it was awesome. I would recommend avoiding any spoilers if you can and play the game as soon as you can.

This game changed how I view story-based games in general. Highly recommend.

## Nier Replicant
This is the prequel to Nier Automata. I played this almost immediately after beating Nier Automata. It definitely felt much less polished, and the gameplay was a little more clunky than Automata. I also found it tedious at times, especially some of the quests (many of the side quests are fetch quests). Despite this, I found that the emotional peaks of the game were greater than the emotional peaks of Automata. The music is absolutely peak.

## Persona 3 Reload
Quite a bit slower compared to Persona 5. In comparison, the story is more character-driven, I find the emotional highs in regards to the characters are much higher for this game. The game is quite a bit darker compared to Persona 5.

I didn't like Mementos in Persona 5, so it wasn't great to see that the only thing in this game was basically Mementos.

## Persona 5 Royal

This game felt *amazing* to play. Every aspect of the experience felt so polished. Even though the game involved a lot of reading for its plot, I didn't mind it that much, because the game felt *that* good to play.

My only complaint is Mementos, that was not so interesting.
