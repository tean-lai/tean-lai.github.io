## League of Legends made me a better student

Playing many hours of League of Legends in high school has made me into a better student.

To truly rank up at the game, one needs humility. Many players blame their poor rank on the bad teammates they get in every game. This sentiment is common in for the average rank divisions. These divisions are even dubbed "elo hell", to emphasize that these ranks are the hardest to climb out of.

The first step to growth is to focus on how you can improve, not how others are holding you back.

Playing league has taught me the effects of the growth mindset. For psychological reasons, I think it's important to have several examples in your life that demonstrate how effort has lead to growth. When you struggle in life, you can fallback on these experiences to motivate you.

I think the combination of these factors had lead to me being a better student as I entered college.
