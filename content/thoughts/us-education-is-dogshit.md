# U.S. Education is Dogshit

U.S. education is absolutely horrendous.

I think there are likely many symptoms of how its dogshit that I have missed observing in my life, but from what I've seen, these are some pretty big issues:
- Textbooks cost too much. Textbooks can easily be over $100 each, and schools might buy enough for the entire class, every several years. This is highly unreasonable though, math doesn't change much within several years. Neither does history, nor literature. And these textbook companies also sell software along with these textbooks, charging for every year. It's disgusting.
- Teachers' salaries are too low. With such low salaries, most teachers must have passion in order to accept such wages given their training. However, the intersection between passionate teachers and highly-skilled teachers are rare. Since the education system is so shit, many teachers are just okay at their subjects. They also sometimes get assigned to teach a class they didn't even major in.
- The way schools are funded encourage increasing class division. Wealthier areas can be taxed more, and have wealthier schools, leading to better prospects. It's a disgusting cycle.
- The standards are way too low. The SATs, for some reason, are the focus of many schools. They care so much about how well their students do. But it's strange to me because the test is quite easy, especially compared to other countries' exams. For many students, they need to pursue other avenues to distinguish themselves. For math enthusiasts, they look at competition math. If they don't get a perfect score on the math SATs, they are below average for many elite colleges. However, there is no reason the SATs cannot replace math competition exams. The problem is, many students may lack the knowledge that math competitions exist. They may be mislead into thinking a perfect score on the math SATs will make them a strong candidate for good math programs, when it's only average.
- Good grades sounds so good, that everyone gets good grades. Grade inflation is real. It's too easy to get good grades these days. It looks bad for the school if students fail, so students don't fail. It's crazy how that works. There becomes no consequences for failure, and now good grades get devalued.
- People rarely fail. Failing sounds so bad, people can't fail. Then students who sometimes can't read, especially after the COVID lockdown years, get promoted to the next grade, and just suffer in their education. We're not doing such students any favors.
