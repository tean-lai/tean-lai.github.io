## What Geometry Dash teaches about success

For those who haven't heard of Geometry Dash, is a side-scrolling platforming video game, where you tap to control a cube to avoid obstacles.

I played this game extensively when I was in middle school, as it was one of the few games I could run on the family computer.

Recently, I've taken a dive back into the game a little bit, and it's given me insight on how I ended up approaching life the way I do. For reference, I'm writing this in my senior year of college.

In Geometry Dash, it's pretty improbably anyone beats any level within their first try. Part of the reason for this is because unlike most platformers, the pacing of Geometry Dash is not under the players control. The game will not stop scrolling, and you jump when you have to, not when you want to. When reading levels for the first time, it can be hard to predict every obstacle that comes.

The only way to beat levels is through repeated attempts. And sometimes, this means a LOT of attempts.

In order to succeed in this game, you NEED to fail. But the reassuring thing is, the more often you fail, the more likely you are to succeed in the end because of the experience you accumulate.

Throughout much of my life post middle school, I have felt fairly unphased by failures. I don't think this was an innate trait of mine. But I do think it was influenced through my gajillion hours spent in Geometry Dash as a middle schooler. It taught me to get used to attempting things frequently and failing frequently. But this is okay! At the end of the day, when you eventually beat the level, it doesn't matter how many attempts you took to get there.

Geometry Dash also taught me how far my skills could get through repeated practice. There were countless levels I thought were impossible for me to beat, but before long, I had found those levels easy. 

Geometry Dash also taught me to be comfortable with how uncomfortable tension can be. As you approach the end of every level, you often experience an insane amount of tension, because failing means you start from the beginning. To beat a level, it also means you need to be able to continue executing precision while under such tension.

Even though one could see Geometry Dash as a fairly pointless game, it ended up being amazing for my development.
