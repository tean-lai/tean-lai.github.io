## Empathy is hard

I think empathy as a term is being overused these days. I don't think it's possible for most people to be able to empathize with most other people, especially when they are different enough.

As a man, how can I ever genuinely say I can empathize for a woman's struggles? I can't.

As someone raised in America, how can I ever genuinely say I can empathize for someone raised in a third-world country?

How can healthy people ever empathize with my own values if they lack the same experiences?

At most, I think you can empathize with experiences that relate to your own. But experiences vary too much in this world. And I think it's disingenious to claim empathy when it's not there in many cases.

Empathy is always overly simplified to "just imagine yourself in their shoes". But we all have different feet sizes. We all wear different shoes. How can someone who has only worn sandals ever imagine what Balenciagas may feel like? I can look at a pair of them, but that doesn't tell me enough about how it feels. We also can't see how well the shoe fits, we can't see if the shoe is defective. There is so much we can't know from just surface level knowing.

And even if we wear the same shoes, we may walk a different path. If we walk the same path, we may walk in a different manner. If we walk in the same manner, we may look at different things.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try to understand each other, we should. But we shouldn't convince ourselves to have achieved empathy when there is more understanding to be done.
