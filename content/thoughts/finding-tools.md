# Finding and settling on tools to use

## Conflict between inner development, and output

Tools no doubtedly affect what you can output. But it also affects *how* you output.

For example, I could choose if I want to use generative AI during my college studies. No doubtedly, it would increase my output while I'm in school, but its continuous use has a chance of decreasing my output in the future, if it negatively affects my ability to develop.

Many tools are not as drastic as AI, but similarly takes away cognitive work that would actually help you grow.
