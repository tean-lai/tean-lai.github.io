## Feeling like an imposter even amongst Asian Americans.

As an Asian American, I find many Asian Americans to be relatable in many ways. But I found there to be a slight disconnect with the Asian Americans I grew up close to in Philadelphia's Main Line.

I originally came from South Jersey, where there are a large population of Cantonese and Vietnamese folks. In my experience, many lacked high education, and many were working class.

But the Asian Americans in the suburbs of Philly were completely different. Most that I met had highly educated families, and there were several instances where different students' parents knew each other by chance, because they attended the Harvard of China.

The attitude towards education was just so different. It's not like the New Jersey Asians didn't value education. But there wasn't an obsession with it. Just going to college was nice. But the Asians near Philly were just completely different. Getting into elite institutions was lowkey an standard, not a goal. And I would see people around me doing extreme amounts of extracurriculars to an extreme degree. It was hard to see the line that divided passion and just raw resume padding.

Having such people around me did motivate me to work harder myself. But sometimes, there were just comments here or there I just found highlighted some disconnects. One comment someone made sarcastically was, "So you're telling me your parents didn't force you to play violin and study computer science?" But I did end up choosing those things through free will. But it's sad to see this free will isn't the norm. I've had peers try to trauma-bond in some way regarding Asian tiger-parenting.
