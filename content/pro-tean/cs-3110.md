CS 3110 is the third programming course in Cornell's undergraduate computer science program.

It focuses on functional programming and immutable data structures.

The course revolves around OCaml, one of my favorite programming languages.

If you're interested in learning more about OCaml or functional programming, I highly recommend the free online textbook: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html.
