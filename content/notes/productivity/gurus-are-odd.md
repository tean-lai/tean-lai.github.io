title = "Productivity content is often odd"
+++

I find it quite strange that there are many YouTube channels that exist solely to produce content on how to be more productive. Often, these are called "productivity gurus". 

It's just odd that many of them produce any other content. They are essentially trying to be productive just for the sake of making more videos about how to be more productive.

In my quest to become more productive myeslf, I watched several of these videos, and it seems like **they repeat themselves often**. Which seems odd, becaues that's **not efficient**.

A lot of these "gurus" run their channels like businesses. But the business model doesn't make much sense to me. For channels to be a sustainable business, they need to retain their audience. For this to be true for the "gurus", it means their viewers must return. But they are returning to watch the same slop, which isn't productive of the viewers.

Another odd thing is that a lot of the common productivity advice they give DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO MUCH. Like decking out a Notion/Obsidian setup is NOT gonna do that much shit, unless you have a good system that you stick with consistently. Half the time, they completely change their setup within a couple months anyways!
