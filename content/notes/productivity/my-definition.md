title = "My definition of productivity"
+++

I think a lot of definitions of **productivity** are odd, because it tends to match the definition of **efficiency**, but to me this didn't feel quite right.

I think it makes more sense to think of **productivity** as the combination of **efficiency** and **effectiveness**.

I think of **efficiency** as the ratio between input and output, where:
- inputs are the time, effort, and resources invested
- outputs are the results achieved

On the other hand, I think of **effectiveness** as the degree in which the outputs match what was intended.
