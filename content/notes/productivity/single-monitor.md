title = "Back to single monitor"

I had a two-monitor setup for a while, but I'm going back to a single monitor.

I never questioned whether using a single monitor only could be more productive. Surely, more information is just better, right?

I finally woke up due to a realization from playing games. I was losing, and felt that I need to lock in, but found the second monitor quite distracting! Even when there was no moving content!

So to protect my ability to focus, I'm back to one monitor.

## Keyboard-centric window management
It's common to want to switch back and forth between two different sets of windows.

Having two monitors let's you do that because you can swap by moving your head.

Having a keyboard-centric window management workflow allows you to switch windows just as quickly with a single monitor.
