## Why I yap about my thoughts and experiences

I think in general, [people should share their thoughts and experiences](../world-view/people-should-share-exp).

But it also has the double-benefit of allowing me to elaborate more about my professional experiences, which can come in handy in looking for new jobs.

## Influences from a course I took in college

I took a communications course centered around designing a portfolio website.

For this course, we analyzed several engineers' portfolio websites. Personally, I disliked sites that essentially their resume but with eye-candy. This pattern was somewhat common, especially junior engineers.

However, the sites I found compelling were from engineers who spent time to talk about things beyond their career. Often they would talk about other tech-related interests, but occassionally I would also see art content. I want my site to be like one of those.

## Why I want this site to be minimal in tech

I try to use little JavaScript in this website.

There are several reasons for this. For one, I'm not interested in front-end web development.

But I also have a distaste at how wasteful we are being with technology. JavaScript is one of the most expensive languages to run, and we run so much of it via the web.

I want this site to feel snappy.

It's still possible to make sites look aesthetically appealing with minimal JavaScript.

## Why this site is static

I chose to make this site static for a couple reasons, static sites are:
- simpler to implement
- more secure
- more performant, in both speed and memory usage
- great for blogs

## Tech stack

Since this site is static, I write everything in markdown and use a static site generator to create the HTML+CSS files. In particular, I use Hugo. For now it works, but I might want to transition into a more minimal tech stack.

I use GitHub to host this site.
