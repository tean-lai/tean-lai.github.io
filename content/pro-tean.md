I'm currently a Head TA for [CS 3110](cs-3110) and an RTL Member for [C2S2](c2s2).

My next stop is returning to Semgrep, to work on program analysis.


## In the past

For one summer internship, I helped with some research. I verified cake-cutting protocols with our domain-specific languge. I did do some memory optimization work to make it possible to verify more complex protocols.

In one summer, I interned at Semgrep. I did more performance optimization work, to boost our engine's taint analysis performance. I learned to profile programs to continuously identify the next areas to focus on improving.

I also did a variety of teaching roles, including working as an Academic Excellence Workshop Facilitator for CS 3410, a course that focuses on systems programming as well as basic computer architecture

In addition to my teaching assistant work, I id a variety of other teaching roles, including working as an Academic Excellence Workshop Facilitator for CS 3410, a course that focuses on systems programming as well as basic computer architecture. I also tutored students in math, competitive programming, SATs, and computer science.

I've also worked customer-facing food service work for Mission BBQ and Martha's Cafe. These jobs had me talking with a lot of people.
