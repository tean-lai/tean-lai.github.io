**protean (adj): able to do many different things; versatile.**

I'm currently:
- a head TA for [CS 3110](cs-3110), a functional programming course
- an member on [Cornell Custom Silicon Systems](c2s2)'s RTL subteam.

My next stop is returning to Semgrep, to work on program analysis.

I've dabbled in a bunch of programming languages, but can really say I'm somewhat proficient with OCaml and Python.

I also enjoy teaching, and have held a variety of teaching roles in the past.

## In the past

### SWE Internship
In one summer, I interned at Semgrep. My main quest was to improve the performance of Semgrep's taint analysis performance by reducing the cost of running dataflow.

There were many tricky parts to this, which I tend to flesh out more in the future.

### Research Internshiop
In one summer, I helped with some research. The research was about verifying envy-free cake-cutting protocols with a custom domain-specific language called Slice.

The verification process involved implementing several protocols from the literature in the language. The main difficulty of this was that these protocols tend to be described with pseudo-code closer to English than any real programming language, and Slice is a linearly-typed functional language, so the translation was not quite 1-to-1.

Verification for these types of problems are just very hard in general, performance can become problematic when verifying complex protocols. Part of my work was in improving the performance of Slice.

### Teaching roles
I also did a variety of teaching roles, including working as an **Academic Excellence Workshop Facilitator for CS 3410**, a course that focuses on systems programming as well as basic computer architecture.

I also **tutored** students in math, competitive programming, SATs, and computer science.

### Customer service
I've also worked customer-facing food service work for Mission BBQ and Martha's Cafe. These jobs had me talking with a lot of people.
