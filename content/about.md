# About Me
Hello! I am Tean Lai, and I'm currently a/n:
- junior computer science major @ Cornell
- Academic Excellence Workshop facilitator for CS 3410
- digital subteam member of Cornell Custom Silicon System project team
- incoming Software Engineering intern in Program Analysis @ Semgrep
- food service employee at Martha's Cafe

Previously, I have been a/n:
- teaching assistant for CS 3110
- undergraduate researcher in programming languages and formal verification

## Academic interests
I am passionate about programming languages, and especially functional programming. My favorite programming language is OCaml, and I'm really interested in learning more Go if I have time.

My other academic interests lie in digital logic and algebra.

# Experiences

## CS 3410 AEW Facilitator
In the fall semester of my junior year at college, I was fortunate to be able to work as an Academic Excellence Workshop (AEW) facilitator for our course CS 3410: Computer Organization and Systems Programming.

Every week, I got to co-lead a workshop, and the problems the class did was up to me. As a teaching experience, I had found this experience to be particularly fulfilling. Although I had enjoyed TAing for CS 3110, our functional programming class, being an AEW facilitator provided me with much more freedom in how I taught.

To elaborate more on what an AEW is, for some engineering courses at Cornell, we offer a supplementary AEW class that is seperate from the main course itself. This separation gave me some agency. Although I was able to lead discussion sections as a TA, the content of those discussion sections were dictated by the course schedule.

In general, I had really enjoyed working as an AEW facilitator. I also really liked the topics we went over the course, which includes digital logic, Risc-V, basic cpu microarchitecture, caching, and more.

I also felt like I had learned a lot about being a more effective teacher, I'm grateful I had this opportunity. Hopefully, I can continue to be an AEW facilitator for semesters to come.

## CS 3110 Teaching Assistant
In my sophomore year of college, I was a TA for the course CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures. I really liked the topic of this course, so I'm glad I got to work as a TA for this course. 


## Food Service
I have worked two food service jobs in my life. Once at Mission BBQ when I was in high school, and once at Martha's Cafe during college. I have to say, these were definitely some of the most life-changing experiences in my life. Food service work is much harder than being a student. I think it's given me additional valuable perspectives in life.
