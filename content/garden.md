## Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden. I am developing some thoughts here, it's kind of like a blog, but also not really. By nature, it is opinionated. However, if there is ever something you disagree with, I am open to hearing more about your thoughts, I'll make an email inbox at some point.
