## Learning OCaml
Jane Street has some pretty good style guidelines regarding programming in OCaml, check them out here: https://opensource.janestreet.com/standards/.

Daniil Baturin on what he wished he knew when learning OCaml: https://baturin.org/docs/ocaml-faq/.

A good intro textbook is the one for CS 3110: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html.

A good intermediate textbook is Real World OCaml: https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html.
