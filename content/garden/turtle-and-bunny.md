## The Tortoise and the Hare (my view)
Out of all children's stories, this one resonated with me the most. It was kind of an inspiring message: work hard and you still got a chance of winning, even if you don't have as much innate talent. It's hopeful, but almost too hopeful.

This story doesn't apply to the real world. The real world is not a 1v1, it's a 1v1v1v1...(insert 8 billion)...v1. If each bunny has a 99% chance of falling asleep during the race, in a race of 100 bunnies versus 100 turtles, it's already only a 37% chance all bunnies will fall asleep; at 500 bunnies, it's less than 1% chance. In that kind of race, every turtle has a near-zero chance of winning.

It seems the only way to win the race is to become a bunny AND work hard like a turtle. But I wonder to what extent you can become more of a bunny...

They always say hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. But what if talent works hard LOL.

That said, you could get far with just hard work alone, I just don't think you could get to the very top. Getting to the top is quite overkill anyways, so it's not like I think you should doom in the face of talent. But it just seems like people like to avoid discussing talent these days. But it's probably better for society if we do talk about it more, and discuss potential ways we can increase talent. I think there is a lot of potential for this, considering how little we understand epigenetics, but also how powerful we keep discovering it to be. Admittedly, I only have a vibes-level understanding of this stuff, but some of my opinions have been informed by friends whom I trust to have a more solid handle of these things!
