## The Tortoise and the Hare (my view)
Out of all children's stories, this one resonated with me the most. It was kind of an inspiring message: work hard and you still got a chance of winning, even if you don't have as much innate talent. It's hopeful, but almost too hopeful.

This story doesn't apply to the real world. The real world is not a 1v1, it's a 1v1v1v1...(insert 8 billion)...v1 battle royal. If each bunny has a 99% chance of falling asleep during the race, in a race of 100 bunnies versus 100 turtles, it's already only a 37% chance all bunnies will fall asleep. At 500 bunnies, it's less than 1% chance. In that kind of race, every turtle has a near-zero chance of winning.

It seems the only way to win the race is to become a bunny AND work hard like a turtle. But I wonder to what extent you can become more of a bunny...
