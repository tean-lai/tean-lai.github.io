# On Courses I've Taken at Cornell

## Semester 1 (Fall 2022)

### CS 2024 C++ Programming
I thought this class wasn't that great. It was only a 2 credit pass/fail class, but even then I feel like I had not learned much C++. The weekly homework assignments could be done within 30 minutes even if you don't go to lecture, so overall, I don't feel as if I had learned that much.

### CS 2110: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures
Prof. Andrew Myers was a pretty great lecturer. His lecture notes were pretty damn amazing too. Overall, I had liked this class. I thought I would hate programming in Java, but I really grew to love it by the end of the semester.

### CS 2800: Discrete Structures
I really liked taking this class. I thought the topics were very interesting, and I'm glad I was able to get exposure to automata theory and formal languages here. 

### MATH 1920: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers
Very standard class on multi.

### ROMS 1109: French Films (FWS)
This was my first writing course here. It was interesting watching french films, but I don't think I became much of a better writer. We had to write about cinematography, but I barely knew what I was even writing about.

## Semester 2 (Spring 2023)
### CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures
Probably my favorite class that I've taken at this school. We learned about OCaml, my favorite programming language, and about the functional programming paradigm. This class has permanently altered the way I think about programs, and I'm glad I had to opportunity to take it.

### CS 4820: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms (aka "algo")
Very interesting class, lots of very interesting topics. Only sad thing was that the lecturers for this course had really bad handwriting.

I think it's really funny how my school refers to every core CS class by their numbers, like 2110, 3110, and 3410, but this class is just "algo". 

### HD 3620: Human Bonding
One of the best courses I've taken at this school. It's such an applicable topic to life. I will probably carry the things I've learned in this class for the rest of my life.

### MATH 2210: Linear Algebra
This class was a snoozefest because studying for algo had made this class easy in comparison.

### NES 1973: Qur'an and Islamic Tradiion (FWS)
I found this class to be very hard. Academically, I am weak in history and writing, and I especially knew nothing about Islam. Part of that was because I had done very little writing of decent quality during the latter half of my high school career. Covid had hit, and all the substantial writing assignments had been severely nerfed. 

But Prof. Raashid Goyal definitely beat me up to shape a litte. This course had fundamentally changed the way I think about writing. After a certain point in grade school, I felt like there wasn't much emphasis on things like grammar, the emphasis was more so on subjective interpretation of books. It was very different for this class. There was an extreme emphasis on grammar. Now, I am at least aware of grammar, although I may not be great at applying it to practice. Grammar is hard folks. But I did find it kind of refreshing hearing someone swear by the important of grammar so much. It reminded me of people who love strong type systems for programming languages. In a sense, grammar is kind of like a type system for natural langauge. My professor's claim was that when grammar is correct, it's much harder for your logic to be unsound. 

## Semester 3 (Fall 2023)

### CS 3410: Computer System Organization
We learned about RISC-V, memory hierarchy, and things like that.

I really liked this class. I thought it was very fun and enlightening to build a simple CPU out of circuitry. I had definitely learned a lot from this class.

### CS 4780: Intro to Machine Learning
I don't think I like machine learning. I didn't find the theoretical aspects of it interesting, neither did I enjoy programming implementing the algorithms in Python. 

### ECON 3130: Probability & Statistics
Prof. Doug McKee was a nice guy, and I think he has a lot of great pedagogy strategies, but I think the content of this class was just too easy, so it kind of cancelled out any of his pedagogy strategies.

### ENGRI 1101: Introduction to Operations Research
Taking algo had trivialized this class. Lost some occasional points here and there though because I didn't go to class and missed out on some heuristics they taught for some problems. Then on exams they would ask for those heuristics to handwave a answer to the question, which was frustrating because I knew how to provide a formal proof instead, but they didn't want that.

## Semester 4 (Spring 2024)
### CS 4110: Programming Languages and Logics
Interesting class, but wished there were more programming assignments. The theoreical assignments felt too much like spamming structural induction over and over again, whch I didn't find that interesting.

### CS 6861: Intro to Kleene Algebra
Hardest class I've taken by far so far. One of the most shocking lectures was during the third week or so, and Prof. Dexter Kozen started talking about different levels of abstraction in algebra, because he needed some category theory to do some proofs. Prior to this semester, I was at "level 1", which is like high school algebra stuff. Apparently, the abstract algebra you would typically see at undergraduatet math degree was "LEVEL 2". THEN HE PROCEEDED TO SAY THAT WE WILL BE DOING SOME WORK AT LEVEL 4. That the scariest introduction to category theory I had ever seen. 

I thought the class was interesting though, a lot of stuff did go over my head, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to take this class.


### MATH 3110: Real Analysis
I found this class to be boring. 

### MATH 3360: Applicable Algebra
Studying for CS 6861 trivialized the abstract math part of this class. I thought it was cool to see some applications of abstract algebra.

## Semester 5 (Fall 2025)

### ECE 2100: Introduction to Circuits
This class is so much work. I am learning a lot about circuits though...


### ECE 3250: Signals and Systems
This class is interesting, I wish we did more proofs though. But it's cool to see appliactions of real and complex analysis.

### ECE 4750: Computer Architecture
Very interesting class! So far, I think the coolest thing we've implemented is a fully pipelined RISC-V processor. Later this semester, we will get to implement a multi-core processor, after having implemented our own cache, I do find that pretty exciting. I think it's a very interesting way to think about computing. I think it's very worth taking computer architecture if you want to have a solid foundation in computing. 

This class has taught me that testing is very hard though.
