## Mental models are overlooked in education

I don't think mental models are discussed enough in education. I'm going to focus the discussion around math, because I think that's where mental models really dominate in importance.

When one studies calculus, often they are not told "how" to think about calculus. They think about how to do calculus.

You end up with a couple possibilities, some people view calculus as simply transformations of equations. But some can visualize why integrating a derivative gets you back. There seem to be a couple more possible models, but I can't recall them at the current moment.

In some cases like this one, it can actually hinder your [transfer of learning](../learning-transfer), like in regards to physics. Many people cannot see how taking the integral of acceleration gives you velocity, they just know that it does, and I think it's because they developed the wrong mental model by chance.

It's definitely possible to develop different models, but we need to talk about it more. It's something that needs to be brought up when teaching a subject. I can't understand why math isn't taught like this, but there could be something about pedagogy that I don't know yet which explains this.

## What if someone has all the "good" mental models?

I think more models can't hurt. It seems many good mathematicians actually make progress with different models, switching around for what enables good progress.
