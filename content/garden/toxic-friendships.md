## Navigating toxic friendships

Shit sucks.

Don't need to cut people off, but it seems like distance management is key. Seems like most friends can be toxic if they get too close, this threshold can vary widely between friends. But when finding the threshold, I think it's always better to stay on the safe side, and not do something like binary search, for you computer science nerds. It's like flying too close to the sun, get too close, and the toxicity will burn.
