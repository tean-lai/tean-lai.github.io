## Illusion of Talent

I am of the opinion that talent does exist in the world. And some individuals are blessed with immense talent that is hard to overcome with hard work. I believe I've met several such individuals and the overwhelming gap they can create when they work hard. Just by the way they talk, I know they process information magnitude faster than me, and I'm not a bad thinker. But also witnessing these few individuals recontextualized what "talent" meant to me. Very few individuals possess real talent, in my opinion.

I've met many people that many others would consider them to be "talented". Either they were good at math, good at instruments, or good at video games. They are definitely in the top 10% of their respected domains, maybe even top 1%. However, I can no longer view them as talented, despite their immense skills.

A lot of that "talent" was backed by hidden hard work. I knew many individuals who were considered "talented" at math, but they were drilled by their parents to do a ton of math! Who is to say most other people wouldn't be good at math if they were drilled to the same extent? Some people got good at video games, but they've played it for hundreds, and maybe thousands of hours! People who were "talented" at art spent many hours drawing! Many "talented" programmers in college programmed for many hours in middle school and high school!

Talent as most people know is an illusion. Only very few individuals possess talents that the majority cannot reach with the sufficient privilege, practice, and mindset.

Sadly, it seems talent is too glorified by the world. People would rather be seen as talented, than simply hard-working. Maybe you've met the archetype of students who claim they never study, but in fact they do.

The presence of "talent" can be damaging to society. Many kids abandon their passions because they don't think they're "good enough" to pursue it, but good enough compared to who? The people who aren't actually talented? All they have is just skill.

High skill is enough to get you very far enough, maybe you need real talent to reach the pinnacle, but that's nothing anyone needs.
