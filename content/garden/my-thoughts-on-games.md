Some thoughts on games I've played.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3
Very satisfying sequel to Xenoblade 1 and 2. Combat system is kind of complicated though, I still have no idea how to play optimally. I don't feel like I have the time to figure it out either. 

## Factorio
The game feels VERY similar to designing and implementing a CPU. Requires quite a bit of brainpower though, so I don't have the energy to play this game much after I do schoolwork. I think this might be a good game to have kids play if you want to trick them into accidently learning engineering principles if you're into that though...

## Nier Automata
This game was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Everything about it just felt really well-made. The music was good, the gameplay was very smooth. The themes were very thought-provoking. I was lucky enough to go into this game with near-zero knowledge of the game, and it was awesome. I would recommend avoiding any spoilers if you can and play the game as soon as you can.

This game changed how I view story-based games in general. Highly recommend.

## Nier Replicant
This is the prequel to Nier Automata. I played this almost immediately after beating Nier Automata. It definitely felt much less polished, and the gameplay was a little more clunky than Automata. I also found it tedious at times, especially some of the quests (many of the side quests are fetch quests). Despite this, I found that the emotional peaks of the game were greater than the emotional peaks of Automata. The music is absolutely peak.

## Persona 3 Reload
Quite a bit slower compared to Persona 5. In comparison, the story is more character-driven, I find the emotional highs in regards to the characters are much higher for this game. The game is quite a bit darker compared to Persona 5.
