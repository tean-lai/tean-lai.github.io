## League of Legends made me a better student

I am of the opinion, that playing many hours of League of Legends in high school has made me into a better student.

To truly get better at the game, humility is a must. I think your rank is in League is a very accurate indiciator of your skill in the game. If you are unable to rank up, you probably deserve that skill. Many players may try to convince you otherwise, that they are simply in "elo hell", that is no matter how good of a player you are, it would be impossible rank up out of there because of the players you get matched with. It's complete bullshit.

Playing league has taught me the effects of the growth mindset. For psychological reasons, I think it's important to have several examples in your life that demonstrate how effort has lead to growth. When you struggle in life, you can fallback on these experiences to motivate you.

I think the combination of these factors had lead to me being a better student as I entered college.
