# On Minimalist Software

In the summer of 2024, I took a dive into Linux (because tiling window managers seemed so damn cool), and along the way, I had discovered the concept of "minimalist software".

To some extent, I do think software these days have become too bloated. So many pieces of software can do pretty much everything. For example, browsers at this point are essentially another operating system. You can play games, edit documents, and run most types of applications at this point.

## Why I think we need more minimalist software
Well, one not so valid reason I think it's absurd is because I do get a bit uncomfortable when critical path becomes too long, and using two operating systems on top of each other feels particularly uncomfortable. 

But the more valid reason is because MY POOR BATTERY LIFE. At this point, I expect laptop batteries to be able to last for a week! This is mostly because my first smartphone was an old one that *was* able to last a week. I would have thought we've reached a point where our cpus get more and more energy efficient and therefore we would have longer battery lives.

## Why I software is so damn bloated

But the unfortunate reality is that as processors get more powerful, we just scale up the software complexity. I think part of the problem is due to rampant consumerism. I think sites like YouTube had been perfect, but now they keep adding extra stuff that I think adds negative value to the site, like YouTube Shorts.

Also, I think websites these days feel too much of the need to look good and fancy. This is probably because these days, we've become such monkeys to the content we consume. Fancy button? We click! 

For the most part, shouldn't the substance be more important? 

To some extent I do think having some level of readability is good. Part of my goals for this website is to have it look decently readable, this means having some sort of centering, and maybe a better font. But there is no need for too much JavaScript nonsense.
